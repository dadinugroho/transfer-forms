# transfer-forms

This is very raw code. It was created few years ago just to help to synchronize between 2 databases. 

The synchronization is not fully automatic as there are still manual requirements that keep changing.

Currently the development is stopped as trasnfer of purchase form is done via web system directly written in PHP, 

there are still to dos 
* separate transfer purchase and transfer sales forms
* automatically sync customer if not yet available in table 2.
* do not create sql row for sales if no details for it.
